# Docker DevOps Bootcamp Tasks
## Description
**Welcome to the Docker DevOps Bootcamp Tasks Repository! This repository provides hands-on tasks designed to help you gain practical experience with Docker, a fundamental tool for modern DevOps practices. Through these tasks, you'll learn how to work with Docker containers, images, and registries**

## Task 01
**Scenario:**
> You are a DevOps Engineer at a company, and your team is setting up a web service using Nginx. You need to pull the official Nginx image from Docker Hub, run it in a container, and verify that it works.

#### Objective: Learn how to find and pull images from Docker Hub ####
#### Instructions: ####
```
•	Search for the official nginx image on Docker Hub.
•	Pull the nginx image using the command
•	Run the nginx container 
•	Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to see the running Nginx server.
```

## Task 02
**Scenario:**
> You are a DevOps Engineer at a startup where the team is transitioning to a containerized microservices architecture. Your task is to create a Dockerize environment for one of the services and push the image to Docker Hub for easy deployment by other team members.

#### Objective: Create and run a Docker container for a basic web application ####
#### Instructions: ####

```
•	Create a new directory named MyDockerApp.
•	Inside the directory, create an index.html file with a simple HTML page that says "Hello, Docker!”
•	Create a Dockerfile in the same directory
•	Build the Docker image 
•	Verify that the image is created by listing the Docker images
•	Run the container, mapping port 80 on the container to port 8080 on the host
```
## Task 03
**Scenario:**
> You are working as a DevOps Engineer, and your team is developing microservices. You've containerized one of the services using Docker, and now you need to share the image with the rest of the team. To make the image accessible, you will push it to Docker Hub, where your team members can easily pull and deploy it in their environments.

#### Objective: Share your Docker image by pushing it to Docker Hub so others can access and use it ####
#### Instructions: ####
```
•	Log in to Docker Hub
•	Tag Your Image
•	Push the Image to Docker Hub
•	Share the Docker Hub Repository URL
```

_Each task comes with clear, step-by-step instructions to help you master Docker commands and workflows. These tasks are designed to teach you essential Docker skills, including how to use Docker Hub for image management and how to deploy containerized applications_
